# ThesisTracker
A simple program for making thesis writing scheduling and to-do lists easy!


I wrote this after feeling that other notetaking or to-do list applications didn't meet my needs. This application is simple: it uses a local JSON file to store your projects and tasks. 

Each project (Command+N) creates a window, and tasks (Command+T) are sorted by date. That's it! When you complete a task, you click the check box, and it moves to the completed task page, a record of your productivity. 

Right now, this program is only available on MacOS, but will shortly be available on Windows and Linux. 

To download:

Open the macOS folder and download the .dmg file.
